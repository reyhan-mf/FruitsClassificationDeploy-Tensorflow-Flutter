## Overview
The primary objective of this project is to discern the freshness of fruits by employing a dataset meticulously curated for this purpose. The dataset encompasses nine distinct types of fruits, boasting a total of over 10,000 images, conveniently accessible through the menu provided in the application interface.

Noteworthy is the achievement of a highly accurate model, boasting an impressive 96% accuracy rate. This feat was accomplished through the application of Transfer Learning, a sophisticated methodology that leverages knowledge gained from one task to enhance the performance of another. Specifically, the project creator opted for the Xception transfer learning approach, showcasing a strategic choice in model architecture to achieve optimal results in fruit freshness classification. Your exploration of the dataset and engagement with the application menu will further illuminate the nuances of this innovative approach.
